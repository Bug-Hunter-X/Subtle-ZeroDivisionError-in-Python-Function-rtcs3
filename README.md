# Subtle ZeroDivisionError in Python Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle error in a Python function that might not be immediately apparent. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` attempts to handle division by zero, but it does so incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## The Bug

The bug is in the handling of the case where `x` is equal to 0. The code intends to avoid division by zero, but the condition is incorrectly handled. This leads to incorrect results or unexpected exceptions.

## The Solution

The solution involves correctly handling the case where `x` is zero and explicitly returning 0 or raising an exception as needed.
